This should enhance the existing ollama ux:

Everything that the TUI ollama provides with the extra following:

1. multi-line input
2. prettified ollama response with `glow`
3. chat history
4. more?...

The existing ollama tui doesnt make it easy to distinguish between code blocks and rich formatting. This program aims to solve that.
