# Jarvis

**Pre-requisites**:
- Ollama
- Glow

This should enhance the existing ollama ux:

Everything that the TUI ollama provides with the extra following:

1. multi-line input
2. prettified ollama response with `glow`
3. chat history
4. more?...

The existing ollama tui doesnt make it easy to distinguish between code blocks and rich formatting. This program aims to solve that.

Need to work on the flickering issue.
